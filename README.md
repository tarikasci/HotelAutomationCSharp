# HotelAutomationCSharp
Base erp software for hotels with entity and facade business layers which communicates with sql database. Can be applied to web ui or winform etc. 
You can see usage of ORM and singleton design pattern.
As I mentioned this is a base version of the programme maybe you can built on this by  designing new user interface.
